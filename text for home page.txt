we understand you have your own thing going

an idea, passion, plan for making some positive change

or maybe you are one of those disruptive innovators who hacked a delivery networks of some monopolist and is just about to rock the boat

in any case, we are just the same

we like stories, we like thinking big and we think in pretty numbers.

numbers tell stories and we are confident our skills and experience could be applied in the context of your story

and since we like to make good use of time,

briefly we would say we specialise in the development and composition of digital noise

which we figured works great in engaging online communities and fits well in advanced initiatives aimed at establishing and maintaining web presence

we are based in london and you probably already met us, so just drop us a line and we we'll be in touch

and if you are still unsure and thinking to yourself: "actually I only need a website for my project"

then we would probably say we are not the best choice for you

but even then leave us your email and short description of this project of yours and we might just ship you off with a sweet and secure site completely for free
